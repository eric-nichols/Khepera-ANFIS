# Khepera-ANFIS
Matlab Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) controller for the Khepera robot is designed for the Khepera to be in motion without touching any objects.

The code requires:
  1. Matlab's Fuzzy Logic Toolbox.
  2. Khepera robot or open source KiKS simulator with modified reference to the Khepera as explained in the KiKS user guide (on line 23 of the code).
